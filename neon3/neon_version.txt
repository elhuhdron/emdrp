NOTE: created own fork and verified head works with emdrp at the point of neon discontinuation.
git clone https://github.com/elhuhdron/neon.git

NOTE: neon mostly only works on the Maxwell (980) and Pascal (1080) architectures.
  It can also run on Kepler (880), but not optimized.
  It was discontinued before support for Turing or any later architectures was added.
